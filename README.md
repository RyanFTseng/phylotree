Generates a phylogenetic tree from a FASTA input and creates a visual display with tree leaves labelled with organism names.
Phylogenetic tree is generated using the clustal omega algorithm and organism names are pulled from the GenBank API.
Clicking on an organism name at a leaf pulls an image of the organism from Google images and displays it next to the tree.
